# OgaDriver
OgaDriver is a decentralized cab ride booking platform, with drivers and riders, where riders can pay for rides with cryptocurrency.<br/>
Drivers receive their percentage of the payments for completed rides made to their wallets instantly whenever a rider makes payment.<br/>
Drivers are screened, approved and onboarded through a "Know Your Clients" (KYC) with a completely decentralized identity (DID).<br/>
Riders are authenticated with their wallet address, and are match to an available driver for their ride through geo-mapping.<br/>
Only electric cabs are allowed on the platform and accredited drivers are encouraged to access cab loans for electric cabs.<br/>
Qualified drivers can access Electric Cab loan, collaterized with certain daily percentage cash-flow from rides completed by drivers.<br/>
Once the Electric Cab loan payment is completed, the cab fully becomes the owner of the driver.<br/>
Crypto to cash equivalent will be displayed on the WittyCab platform for seamless payment transactions.<br/>
Payment of Electric Cab loan will be made in crypto, from the driver wallet to the WittyCab wallet.
